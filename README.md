# DSA-using-C
**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C**  This repository contains a collection of fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming) implemented in C. It aims to provide clear, well-documented code for learning and practice. Contributions welcome!
